[esp-js-react](https://github.com/esp/esp-js-react) contains lightweight common infrastructure to help you build [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) apps using [esp-js](https://github.com/esp/esp-js).
`RouterProvider` and `SmartComponent`, both React components are included. 
Additionally a `@viewBinding` decorator is included which can be used with `SmartComponent` for dynamic view resolution of a model. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/esp/esp-js-react) for documentation.
