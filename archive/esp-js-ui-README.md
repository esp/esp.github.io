# Evented State Processor (ESP) UI
Here you'll find an initial release of `esp-js-ui`, a framework to build modular apps using [esp-js](https://github.com/esp/esp-js) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). 

What's Included?
* Business module abstraction - allows you develop independent modules and have them take part in a larger app.
* Components - build components and have them loaded and saved with the modules that own them.
* Region management - allows components to interact with regions without having to worry about where those regions exist within the app's layout.
* Dependency injection - fully supported DI using [micro-di](https://github.com/KeithWoods/microdi-ts).
* Business state management - uses [esp-js](https://github.com/esp/esp-js), a library to manage complex state, for all UI state management.
* React - Uses [esp-js-react](https://github.com/esp/esp-js-react) to load views built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).
